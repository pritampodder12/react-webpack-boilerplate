# React Boilerplate with Webpack, Tailwind CSS, SCSS

This project is a boilerplate setup for a React application, created using **Webpack**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **SCSS**.

## Key Features

1. **Manual Setup**
   - All necessary development dependencies were manually installed, providing greater control over the project structure.

2. **Webpack Configuration**
   - **Webpack** is used to bundle all modules required for running the React project.
   - The configuration is handled in the `webpack.config.js` file.

3. **Babel Configuration**
   - **Babel** is configured to ensure the browser can understand JSX syntax.

4. **SCSS Integration**
   - **SCSS** is used for styling, and it's integrated into the Webpack configuration.

5. **Tailwind CSS Installation**
   - **Tailwind CSS** is installed and configured, enabling utility-first CSS for rapid UI development.

## Purpose

This boilerplate serves as an example to demonstrate that **Next.js** might not be necessary for small web applications. The setup can be reused in future projects when building a web application from scratch.

## Installation Guide

You can easily set up a new React application using this boilerplate by running the following command:

```bash
npx @ppodder/simple-react-app myApp
```

## Upcoming Features

1. **Setup Dev, UAT, Prod Environment**
   - Plan to establish distinct development, UAT (User Acceptance Testing), and production environments.

2. **Docker Implementation**
   - Integrate Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.

3. **CI/CD Implementation**
   - Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment processes.
